# CoVFit
A protein language model for accurately predicting the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 variants

## Summary
Continually emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants lead to repeated epidemic surges through escalated spreading potential (i.e., fitness). This repsitory hosts the software and code of CoVFit, a protein language model able to predict the fitness of newly emerged variants based solely on their spike protein sequences.

## Contents
### CoVFit-CLI
- The CoVFit models can be used as a stand-alone command line tool to predict the viral fitness of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences in fasta format. Download link and instructions are available [here](https://github.com/TheSatoLab/CoVFit/blob/main/CoVFit_CLI/ReadMe.md).
### CoVFit Training
