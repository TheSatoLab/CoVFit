# CovFit
A protein language model for learning the SARS-CoV-2 fitness landscape

## Summary
SARS-CoV-2 has increased its potential to spread, i.e., fitness, through the acquisition of mutations, leading to repeated epidemic surges. The genetic basis of viral fitness elevation could be elucidated by modeling the relationship between genotypes and their fitness. Here, we introduce CovFit, a protein language model predicting the fitness of variants based on their spike (S) protein sequences.
