# CoVFit
A protein language model for accurately predicting the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 variants

## Summary
Continually emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants lead to repeated epidemic surges through escalated spreading potential (i.e., fitness). Here, we introduce CoVFit, a protein language model able to predict the fitness of variants based solely on their spike protein sequences.

## Contents
### CoVFit-CLI
- The CoVFit models can be downloaded and used as a stand-alone command line tool to predict the viral fitness of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences in fasta format. Download link and intructions are in the example section.
### CoVFit Training
- Training
- Figures
- Dataset
### Domain Adaptation
- Code used for performing domain adaptation to produce the ESM-2<sub>coronaviradae</sub> model available [here](https://github.com/TheSatoLab/CoVFit/blob/main/Domain%20Adaptation/Domain_Adaptation_training.py).
